Ramona grabbed Marty's hand and whispered: "Something isn't right here! Let's go!"

They walked down hallways 

A sign: "INFIRMARY"

The radio in the hospital room still played a tune. A nasal pop-punk voice intoned:

    The course of true love never did run smooth
    Lovers drift away and lovers move
    We can't communicate with those who've left
    And when they leave it's like a little death

The heart rate monitor emitted a single, long tone.
