They convened in the board room. An American flag covered the wall behind the table, its colors surreally bright.

"We need to *control the narrative*. How many people saw it?"

"Five, according to the security cameras."

"Okay. WE need to desroy their credibility. But it's better if we can link them together somehow. Who's a plausible leader?"

"Maybe... well, we want to go conventional, so not the women. That leaves Hammer or Sedgwick."

"What are they like? Pull up their files."

"Hammer is... moody."

...

"Any Arabs?"

"No. Sedgwick is half-um, African American, half-Latino," said Dartle.

"Good--he's the introducer."

Ms. K scowled.

"Hey, I don't write the rules, I just play the game," said Hartman.

The flag seemed to shimmer as he spoke.

"Did any of them take a picture?"

"Yes. The gothy one. She was filming with her phone," said Ms. K.

"Damn it. Well, is it ready yet?" said Hartman.

"The influencing machine?" said Ms. K. "It's been running for the past 48 hours."

"Excellent."
