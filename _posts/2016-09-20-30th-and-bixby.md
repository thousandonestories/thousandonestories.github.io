ALMOST every Friday and Saturday night that winter, dressed up or straight from work... they poured shots of cheap alcohol in kitchens and living rooms. They marched their separate paths to that apartment on 30th and Bixby. They mounted the wooden steps to the third floor in the cold. Striking the door, they took a moment to see if any friendly face was coming up the stairs, a name to shout into the night; or if any raucous souls were perched atop the roof.
