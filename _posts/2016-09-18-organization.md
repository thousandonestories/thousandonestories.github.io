Found:

* "almost every friday and saturday night!!" > in China 练习本

Still haven't found:

* "engineering girl" character -- in *another* engineering notebook?
    * Hannah Oxbridge

    Engineering notebooks so far:

    * "Novel" / "fuck haters" (feel like it's actually early on in there somewhere)
    * One filled with "Sketches of a Director" stuff
    
    On computer: /Users/edk/Dropbox/2013\ spring/daily  -- "Oxbridge"

* Jekyll
    * Pretty clean
    * Easier to stay organized than just files
* thousandonestories
    * shared with others


How will I stay organized, just me, in immense disorganized nature?

The Crystal Dragon--thinking about mood, varying it

Have a few characters

* Sedgwick
* Hammer
* Hartman
* Ms K

A bit of each of their lives? 

* Haven't thought about Ms K's life much 
* Sedgwick backstory w/ musician father

    What did Joseline's parents do? something working-class, don't remember
    The point is, people who *just* moved from Mexico are probably not starting bands
        That's not true 

        But! I do want to explore a working class family / life / beginning with one or two characters

Think about variation of mood in my own life

* Fun / happy times at Karam's house

* Adventure -- Napo times ("pretty much thrown together" story)

* Despair... shame at Best Value Inn (and then walking in and those carpeted stairs!!)

The lobby had a facade with Hellenic (asd) cherubs.
The room itself had a tub barely big enough for one person.
